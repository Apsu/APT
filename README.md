# APT Layout

This is an alternate keyboard layout initially based on the work done in [MTGAP][1] and [CTGAP][2] [[notes](#notes)].

```txt
q c d l x  z y o u ;
r s t h k  p n e i a
w g b m v  j f ' , .
```

My [Keyboard.io Atreus](https://keyboard.io/atreus) configs are in the [Atreus](Atreus) directory.
