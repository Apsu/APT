# APT Layout

This is an alternate keyboard layout initially based on the work done in [MTGAP][1] and [CTGAP][2].

```txt
x c d k q  j p u o ,
r s t l m  y n e a i
w g b h v  z f ' ; .
```

My [Keyboard.io Atreus](https://keyboard.io/atreus) configs are in the [Atreus](Atreus) directory.


## Genkey

[Semilin's Genkey analyzer](https://github.com/semilin/genkey) heatmap and stat breakdown, using top 500 trigrams for analysis.
