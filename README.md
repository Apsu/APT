# APTAP Layout

This is an alternate keyboard layout initially based on the work done in [MTGAP](https://mathematicalmulticore.wordpress.com/the-keyboard-layout-project/) and [CTGAP](https://github.com/CTGAP/ctgap-keyboard-layout), with changes inspired by symmetric punctuation in the center columns as seen in [Engram](https://engram.dev/) and [Halmak](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak).
