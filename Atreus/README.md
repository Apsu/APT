# Atreus Keymap

Since I use an Atreus keyboard, I have a custom setup for the rest of my keymap that works in conjunction with the layout.

The JSON config file for the Keyboard.io graphical configurator [Chrysalis](https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis) is included [here](APT.json).

## Base Layers

The first layer is the APT layout, with some additional punctuation on the extra middle keys.

Mods are symmetric in the bottom corners, and extra layers are dual-function on the thumb home keys.

Next is the navigation and shortcut layer, and is also where `Escape`, `Caps Lock`, `Menu`, `Print Screen`, `Scroll Lock`, `Pause`, and `Num Lock` live. The whole bottom row is passthrough.

Last is the number and symbol layer. Function keys are setup here as well, along with the remaining symbol keys. Again the bottom row is passthrough.
